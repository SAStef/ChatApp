Cyberteknologi DTU opgave

This project was made as an exercise for the DTU subject, Cyberteknologi del 2. 

The project is basically a messaging app. In this project, a TCP server was coded and implemented, which acts as a midpoint and controller, 
along with a client-application which is a python file to be run by each client on each end of the connection. The whole project is singlehandedly coded with python, 
where the UI implementation was done with the library PyQt6 and multithreading was used along with a socket connection.
